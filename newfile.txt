We have successfully created a file.
We will now write into the file using file handling.
The 'writelines()' method writes multiple lines into the file
It takes a list of strings as an input.
It does not include line breaks so we will add it manually.
This is an additional line of text wich is appended into the file using append mode.newfile.txt
